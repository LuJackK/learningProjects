<h1>CASE 1:</br>30 years ago, Soviet journalists were killed in Yugoslavia. Why was no one punished for their deaths?</h1>
<img src="https://balkaninsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photosofviktornogin-left-andgennadiykurinnoyonacommemoration-photocourtesyofvladimirmukusev.jpg" alt="case_img">
<p>During the years of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_War_of_Independence " target="_blank">Croatian War of Independence</a> (1991-1995), 45 journalists were killed on the territory of Yugoslavia. The first victims of the armed conflict were employees of the USSR State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company Viktor Nogin and Gennady Kurinnoy. 30 years ago, on September 1, 1991, their car was shot down near the village of Hrvatska Kostajnica on the Belgrade-Zagreb highway. Their bodies were never found, but in March 2017, despite their status as missing, President of Russia Vladimir Putin awarded them the Order of Courage posthumously. It was only in 2021 that the case got off the ground, but there are still more questions than answers.</br>

On a formal level, the war on the territory of the former Socialist Republic of Croatia began only in the summer of 1991, after on June 25, following Slovenia, it declared independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). But the first conflicts between the Croatian authorities and local Serbs, of whom more than 600 thousand lived there, began in the summer of 1990. The language was the source of contention.</br>

The fact is that the Croatian Democratic Union (CDU) party, which won the first multi-party elections in May 1990, led by Franjo Tudjman, immediately renamed the Serbo-Croatian language into Croatian, changed its grammar, and banned the use of Cyrillic on the territory of the republic. Any mention of events from the history of Serbia, as well as Serbian writers and poets, were excluded from the school curriculum.</br>

In addition, public discrimination against Serbs began in Croatia. Thus, one of the leaders of the CDU, later President of Croatia, Stipe Mesic, said that the local Serbs own as much land as they can carry on the soles of their shoes. And Franjo Tudjman called the Independent State of Croatia created by Hitler, where more than a million Serbs were killed by local Ustashe fascists in 1941-1945, the result of "thousand-year aspirations of the Croatian people."</br>

Discrimination was also formal: all Serbs working in the power structures, primarily militsiyamen, were forced to sign a humiliating “letter of loyalty” (nothing like this was required from Croats and representatives of other nationalities). As a result, in May 1990, parallel power structures began to form in Serb-populated areas of Croatia. In early July 1990, the militsiya of the city of Knin, led by Milan Martic, refused to obey the Ministry of the Interior of Croatia, after which militsiya units in other areas where the majority were Serbs began to announce the same thing.</br>

On August 17, 1990, special forces moved out of Zagreb into the recalcitrant areas. The military was ordered to remove all weapons from the rebellious militsiya stations. This was done only in the town of Benkovac. The response of the Serbs was the "Log Revolution" - the widespread construction of barricades on the territory of Serbian communities. Because of this, communication between the northern and southern parts of Croatia was effectively terminated. Later, this day in the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina was celebrated as a public holiday - the Day of the Uprising of the Serbian people.</br>

In March 1991, the first armed clashes began between Serbian self-defense units and units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Guard, and the Armed Forces of Croatia. According to the laws of the SFRY, all of the above structures were illegal armed formations. Weapons and ammunition came to Croatia from abroad, mainly from Hungary. At the same time, the Yugoslav People's Army did not intervene in these clashes for a long time, only creating separate zones of demarcation between the conflicting parties in the hottest spots.</br>

Even after the declaration of independence of Croatia, parts of the Yugoslav People's Army were in no hurry to oppose the separatist armed units, most likely due to the indecision of Belgrade and the lost ten-day war in Slovenia in July 1991. This made it possible for the Croatian troops to consolidate their forces and establish general control, which was also helped by foreign military forces. Already on September 19, there was a massive attack by Croatian armed units on the Yugoslav People's Army barracks, which were completely captured within a month. But as of September 1, 1991, clashes in Croatia were still local.</br>

At the time of the business trip to Yugoslavia, the USSR State Radio and Television correspondent Viktor Nogin already had experience in the combat zone in Afghanistan. However, the Balkans were his love, because in 1972 Nogin graduated from the Faculty of Journalism of the University of Zagreb. But the flourishing and peaceful Yugoslavia, which he remembered from his youth, no longer existed.</br>

Throughout August 1991, Viktor and his cameraman Gennady Kurinnoy traveled to the battlefields in Croatia almost every day, filmed, returned to Belgrade, and transported materials to Moscow. In the evening they watched the story on the Vremya program, after which they talked with colleagues until midnight. Yugoslav television often invited Viktor as a guest on their air to show exclusive footage of the fights.</br>

On the morning of September 1, 1991, having filmed a celebratory assembly at the school at the USSR Embassy in Belgrade, Nogin and Kurinnoy left in the direction of Zagreb. They were going to shoot a material about the Serbo-Croatian armed conflict, to then overtake it to Moscow from the capital of Croatia. The journalists left in a dark blue Opel Omega car, which traveled many fronts of the Yugoslav war. Huge white letters TV were stuck on its hood and doors - such ones can be seen from afar. The license plates on the car were diplomatic - 10-A-155. But the journalists never made it to Zagreb.</br>

<img src="https://balkaninsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Volunteer_workers_have_a_rest_while_reading_the_newspaper__Borba__building_of_New_Belgrade_1948-1950-scaled-e1601888383806.jpg" alt="case_img">
The Croatian Interior Ministry noted that the investigation was conducted with the international assistance of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Russia.

According to Croatian law enforcement officers, on September 1, 1991, Nogin and Kurinnoy entered the village of Hrvatska Kostajnica, which at that time was under the control of Croatian units. There, journalists recorded interviews with residents, members of the Croatian militia, and the police. The interlocutors warned them that the road from Kostajnica to Petrinja was not safe, but Nogin replied: "Don't worry, I have experience in the Afghan war, you Croats are good people, and the Serbs are our brothers."</br>

However, when a car with diplomatic plates drove up from Kostajnica, a group of criminals opened fire on the car with small arms. The wounded Viktor Nogin shouted "Don't shoot, we are your brothers," but that didn't help.</br>

When the car stopped, the shooters approached, and the 26-year-old suspect demanded that the wounded show their documents: passports and press cards. He then killed the journalists by shooting them in the head with a pistol. Most of the members of the unit, including its commander, the second suspect, became witnesses.</br>

The Interior Ministry said in the statement: “Although the 33-year-old suspect, as a commander, was obliged to prevent the shooter, he did nothing and, together with members of the group, took several actions to conceal the circumstances of the crime.” Later, the journalists' car was looted and burned along with the corpses. The charred remains were hidden in the territory, which was then controlled by the Serbs. Most of the described facts have been known since 1992. The only news is that the perpetrators have been identified and are still alive.</br>

Information about whether Croatia applied to the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a request for the extradition of the suspects in the murder of Nogin and Kurinnoy is not publicly available. Thus, in this case, instead of a dot, there is still an ellipsis....</p>

<h1>CASE 2:</br>Mystery of Croatian School Massacre Unsolved, 25 Years On</h1>
<p>Twenty-five years after the killing of nine elderly and disabled civilians who had taken refuge at a school in the Croatian town of Dvor, Serbian and Croatian officials continue to blame the other side’s troops, and no one has ever been charged.
On August 8, it will be exactly 25 years since Christian Jensen witnessed this incident, which he described a few days after it happened to Danish investigators who sent their findings to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, ICTY.

At the time, Jensen was a 54-year-old senior sergeant with the Danish battalion of the United Nations mission in Croatia. The battalion was based on a playing field 35 metres from the school building in the town of Dvor, which had been part of the territory held by the secessionist Republic of Serbian Krajina, an unrecognised entity established by rebel Croatian Serbs within Croatia in 1991 as Yugoslavia collapsed.</p>

<h1>CASE 3:</br>The story of a man living in Croatia with no ID or knowledge who he is. For the last 36 years</h1>
<img src="https://img.24sata.hr/broHTuOM2AvhovrqRLOdRcB75Ig=/1243x700/smart/media/images/2016-34/covjek_rab-1_gdTRJCO.jpg" alt="case_img">
<p>A case has recently hit the Croatian press about a man "with no identity", lost in the system for decades, living in obscurity at the psychiatric hospital on the island of Rab. So, here goes...

On a warm summer's day, August 19th 1980, a young man, a teenager roughly between the ages of 16 and 18 was found wandering aimlessly near the town of Drniš, in the hinterlands of Dalmatia. He didn't know his name, was unable to say where he lived, who his parents were, if he had any siblings. Tabula rasa. He was thrown around between various state institutions. Communication with him was difficult and he was determined to have a solid degree of "intellectual disability". The state bureaucracy, both Yugoslav and later Croatian had no sympathy for him, refusing to print documents for him if his identity cannot be established, which it couldn't, but provided him with free health insurance. That meant that, instead of being treated at a rehabilitation center, he was confined to the above mentioned hospital ever since he first set foot in it - on September 9th 1980. For 36 years.

The man now responds to "Perica Matas", a name which came from the conviction of a fellow patient at the hospital that he was a person by that name he knew from Lećevica, a village in the Dalmatian hinterland. That proved to be wrong, but the name stuck. He's a simple, happy, friendly, communicative person everybody at the hospital likes. His everyday ritual, is to use the little money he collects from others to buy himself a donut and a Coke, one in the morning, one in the evening. Mentally still a child, he sometimes acts a bit childish to draw attention, but without any malice. Though communicative and responsive now, communication with him is still difficult, as he cannot articulate words properly, though the staff has learned to understand him better and taught him to speak better.

Efforts have been made from the hospital's side to identify him, but the bureaucratic wall didn't help much with most instances. Local police fingerprinted him, took DNA samples, took photos of him but was unable to determine who he was. Though, it's questionable how much actual effort was put into that and if they had even spread his picture around in the media properly. The staff have said that if his identity could not have been determined that he should've been given new documents so that he enjoys the rights everybody else enjoys, but no luck there and all the efforts in that direction were fruitless.

For 36 years there was no media exposure of this case at all. The public was clueless. Now, once the staff have put his case in at least temporary spotlight, somebody might remember something... The Drniš area did not have it easy, the town itself was attacked and taken by Serbian forces in 1991, prompting a flood of refugees, most of which returned in/after 1995, once it was liberated. But not everybody had survived or returned. Is his family still there, if it ever was? A huge amount of people have simply vanished during the war, likely meeting a tragic end, people are still looking for their loved ones, so you can, I guess, imagine that a person who is actually certainly alive and kicking and at a known location would not be high priority for the authorities.

People in Drniš are in shock about this A village around those parts is apparently known for... not spreading their genes readily beyond the limits of the village... and children with problems like Perica weren't unheard of, but all seem "accounted for", no stories of a missing child, especially of that age ever came out. An article does state that a woman who worked in the hospital there remembers a case where a young patient, originally from Serbia, had literally jumped out of the window and escaped, never to be seen again around that time. Could that have been him? Is there still anybody who remembers that young man's case better? We'll see. The people there are naturally angry at the state for its treatment of Perica.

The articles seem to have actually been sparked by news that the ministry of health had suddenly refused to provide further medical insurance for Perica (I'd lie if I said that this is the biggest evil politicians in power caused within the last year, but let's not go there), which shocked the people at the hospital he's at. Now the story goes is kicking around on the internet and who knows... there might be a break. DNA profiling & all is a bit on the science fiction side, perhaps, without a proper, extensive database for comparison in the region, so that's likely out, but who knows...</p>

<h1>Body in Croatian freezer might be woman missing for <i>18 years</i>.</h1>
<p>ZAGREB: The mystery of a Croatian student who disappeared 18 years ago might have been solved with the discovery of a body in a freezer, press reports said Sunday.

The freezer was in a home in Mala Subotica, northern Croatia, belonging to the sister of Jasmina Dominic, who was 23 when she went missing in 2000, they added.

Dominic was studying in Zagreb at the time, and her family informed police that she was gone only five years later, the daily Vecernji List said.

Late Saturday, a 45-year-old woman was arrested in Mala Subotica in connection with the investigation, regional police spokesman Nenad Risak told AFP.

"We suppose that the body found in the freezer is that of a woman born in 1977 and whose disappearance was reported on August 16, 2005," he said.

Police believe the person was murdered but are still awaiting autopsy results, the spokesman added.

He declined to identify the woman who had been arrested, but local media said it was the victim's sister.

The website eMedjimurje reported that the body had been found in a house where the sister lived with her husband and three children.

Dominic's father, who died a few years ago, said in 2011 that his daughter told him in 2000 that she was going to work on a cruise ship and that she also intended to live in Paris.</p>

<h1>Tekačevo: The Most Gruesome Homicide You've Never Heard Of</h1>
<img src="https://images.24ur.com/media/images/1100x619/Mar2017/29304c06f0_61896158.jpg?v=9a58" alt="case_img">
<p>In eastern Slovenia, in a region known as "Lower Styria" or "Štajerska" by the Slovenes, there's a quiet little village. Its population numbers no more than 250 people and its small local economy is based primarily on agriculture, what there is of it in the small land area of the village. However, over 20 years ago, on the 5th of March 1997 this small rural village would be the scene of one of the most gruesome crimes in Slovenian history, a quadruple homicide, which despite a suspect officially being convicted for the crime is still widely considered to be an unsolved case.

We shall get into the events of the incident soon, however if we wish to understand what happened on that fateful day in the small village of Tekačevo we must first look into the background - who was killed and possible reasons as to why, so let's dig in.

The murders at Tekačevo had 4 victims, out of which 3 were female, including 1 17 year old. The oldest among them was 75-year old Štefan Poharc. Štefan had previously worked at Zavarovanje Triglav, one of Slovenia's largest insurance companies, but upon retiring had supposedly entered into shady business, whether or not this is completely true is unknown and will likely never be known, however it is possible and what definitely is known is that Štefan had quite the fortune for such a rural area. Myths surround him in regards to supposed drug trafficking, selling counterfeit alcohol and even the illegal arms trade, this last one actually likely being the most plausible of the three due to the arms trade being especially prominent in the Lower Styria area in the 90s due to wars and power struggles in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia in the wake of the collapse of Yugoslavia.

Štefan would often flaunt his wealth in local bars which was bound to have made him several enemies. He also reportedly didn't trust banks, and kept all his money in the form of cash at home. This combined with his constant flaunting of wealth is a possible, in fact the most possible reason he and the three other victims were convicted to the fate they received. He shared the house with his wife, 73-year old Frančiška Poharc and 2 sub-owners, 36-year old Helena Krošlin and her 17-year old daughter Viktorija. As mentioned, the crime was most likely a robbery, one where something went horribly wrong, caused by Štefan's wealth which he made no attempts at hiding and the fact he kept his wealth in cash at his residence. Now, let's look into the events of the homicide.

The crime was carried out with a Russian made Makarov pistol. It's speculated the first to die was Frančiška, Štefan's wife, who died after she was shot in the head from about half a meter's distance while cleaning a hallway the house at around 5:30 PM. After her came 17-year old Viktorija, who was sitting in the kitchen reading a book, and who actually was supposedly breathing for hours following her shooting, meaning she was likely the last of the 4 to die. Štefan came rushing down to the kitchen after hearing the two gunshots. Once he arrived the assailant shot him in the leg, likely in an attempt to force him to tell them where he was hiding his wealth and was likely forced to open the safe in the master bedroom, however the criminals didn't find all they were looking for inside the safe, so they put Štefan in handcuffs, ones made in Croatia, and forced him, at gun point, to the neighbouring estate, where the assailants were likely surprised by Helena Krošlin who was in the basement of the estate at the time when they brought in Štefan. She was shot in the head and died instantly. After half an hour, of likely trying to get him to tell where the remaining fortune was, they shot Štefan in the head from a direct distance, killing him instantly.

Following the crime, once the police were called, they uncovered several pieces of evidence, including a sweater and improvised balaclava which was tossed away by the assailants after the crime. On both of them forensics found hairs, none of which matched Kristijan Kamenik, an, at the time, 25-year old man from Slovenske Konjice, who was almost immediately following the murder made the prime suspect in the killing. Despite the hairs on the mask and sweater not belonging to him police found two footprints, one in the clay floor of the estate where Štefan was killed, and one on a piece of paper in the actual Poharc residence, which ended up matching a pair of Nike shoes owned by Kamenik.

These same shoes have however been compared to the prints found several times and rather interestingly, in 1999 when the shoes were given to a Swiss laboratory in Lausanne who concluded the right shoe, which supposedly made the footprint on the piece of paper was too small to match to the footprint. The hairs found on the sweater and mask were found to belong to two different people, neither of which were any of the victims nor Kamenik, however interestingly the two people the hairs belong to were found by comparing DNA to be related however the actual identities of the two persons are as yet unknown.

What is however very interesting is that despite the event being supposedly a robbery gone wrong currently resting as the most popular and perhaps most likely theory, there are some details which do seem to disprove it. For example the cold blooded murder of two defenseless females, Štefan's 73-year old wife and a 17-year old Viktorija. It just doesn't add up if it were a robbery gone wrong why the thieves would shoot both of them at direct range, killing Frančiška immediately and dooming Viktorija to a slow and painful death on the floor of the kitchen, followed up by the seemingly non-hesitated and indeed very direct murder of Helena Krošlin. It would seem if it was meant to be a robbery that there would be some calculation in the actions of the assailant(s) instead of just going in all guns blazing. There were not even any signs of struggle to be found, indicating the murderer truly did kill in cold blood, without hesitation, without prior warning or real reason. Something else interesting would appear to be the fact that Kamenik was supposedly hitting on 17-year old Viktorija prior to the murders despite being 8 years her senior.

There is also the fact Štefan was wearing Croatian made hand cuffs, combined with speculations regarding the activities of Štefan Poharc following his retirement, specifically the arms trade with Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. Kamenik who does seem to be a likely suspect along with two other as yet unknown accomplices is a known career criminal and even spent some time some years back in Croatian prison and very likely has connections to the mafia, various cartels and has been speculated of himself being active in the Balkan arms trade in the 90s. One theory is that Poharc was involved in the arms trade with Serbia and Kamenik with Croatia and in exchange Croatian authorities would look the other way while Kamenik was taking care of drug business in Croatia, then once the war ended Croatian authorities hired Kamenik to take out Poharc as a bit of late revenge for him supplying the Serbs.

But that's just one theory which I found particularly fascinating, I won't actually delve too deep into the theories and let you come up with some on your own if you find this fascinating. Seeing how positively the community reacted to my post about Bohinj yesterday I just thought I'd share another Slovene mystery since obscure, relatively unknown cases seem to really fascinate you all. The sources I used are once again all in Slovenian, however unlike the Bohinj cases I sadly wasn't able to find any English language sources, not even poorly translated ones, for those of you really interested to read about
